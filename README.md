# 🔐 Network Packet Sniffing Project

## 📄 Description
Used tcpdump and Wireshark inside Kali Linux VM to sniff and analyze packets. Practiced identifying protocols like HTTP, DNS, ARP, and inspected network behavior.

## 🧠 What I Did
- Installed tcpdump and Wireshark
- Captured live traffic using tcpdump
- Saved to `.pcap` and opened with Wireshark
- Applied filters to analyze HTTP, DNS, and TCP activity

### ✅ Step 2: Live Packet Sniffing with tcpdump
Watch live traffic flow through your VM interface.

### ✅ Step 3: Save and analyze packets on wireshark
Store captured packets in a .pcap file and analyze packets using GUI filters.
